                    <p>
                        I worked on the Data Team as a Software Engineer Intern. We used Java with Apache Beam and
                        Google DataFlow to process and analyze data from mobile devices. I worked on the Data Quality
                        team, where I worked on a project to improve the quality of the data we collected. I also worked
                        on the Data Pipeline team, where I worked on a project to improve the performance of our data
                        pipeline. While working on these projects, I learned a lot about data processing and geo data.
                        Some of the technologies I used were Java, Apache Beam, Google DataFlow, Google Cloud
                        Platform,Terraform, and Docker.
                        Notable achievements include developing an Apache Beam job using Dataflow runner class to
                        generate geohashes based on country and upload the geohashes to Google Cloud Platforms Big
                        Query.
                        I also optimized Big Query Monitoring job by using parallel computing, selective fetching, and
                        code refactoring to reduce runtime of job from 20 minutes to 17 seconds.
                        Furthermore I learned some Terraform and Terraformed a project to easily manage service
                        accounts, permissions, and infrastructure.

                        I worked on the Mobile Team as a Mobile Engineer Intern. I reported to both Android and iOS
                        heads of the PDFTron mobile team as I was in charge of their cross platform SDK projects such as
                        React Native, Flutter and Xamarin.
                        I worked on the React Native project, where I worked on a project to improve the performance of
                        the React Native SDK. I also worked on the Flutter project, where I worked on a project to
                        improve the performance of the Flutter SDK. While working on these projects, I learned a lot
                        about React Native and Flutter. Some of the technologies I used were React Native, Flutter,
                        Java, C# and Objective-C. I had also spent some time working on Github Actions.
                        Notable achievements include upgrading the React-Native version of sample apps from 0.58 to 0.67
                        as well as transform class components to functional components to use React Hooks.
                        I also implemented GitHub actions to automate publishing to pub.dev and npm whenever a new
                        feature isintroduced.

                    <p>
                        I worked on the Aquarius Sample Team as a Software Engineer Intern. I did full stack development
                        with Java, Spring Boot, AngularJS, and PostgreSQL. All the features I developed included unit
                        tests,
                        Selenium UI test and integration tests. Some features also included Cucumber tests. This
                        internship was my first experience into the world of devOps and I learned a lot about it.
                        I was able to learn more about CI/CD pipelines and how to use Jenkins to create one and about
                        AWS tools.
                        I also learned more about Docker and how to use it to create containers. Furthermore a lit bit
                        of Solr as well, just a little bit.
                        Notable achievements include automating creation and maintenance of RDS instances with AWS
                        CloudFormation using YAML templates and bash scripts to automate deployment for RDS by 100%.
                        Creating secrets in AWS secrets manager and cache secrets using AWS library in
                        C3P0 to remove 100% occurrences of database credentials from source code

                        I worked on the Peloton Team as a Software Engineer Intern. I did full stack development with
                        ASP.Net MVC framework. This was my first coop and it gave me the first real world software
                        engineering experience.
                        I was able to learn more about the software development life cycle and how to work in a team.
                        Moreover I learned about how Payments Processing works in the internet as well various things
                        about the financial technology space. On the frontend side of things I learned JQuery, KendoUI
                        and basic Javascript topics.
                        While on the backend side of things I learned C#, ASP.Net MVC, Entity Framework, SQL Server and
                        various design patterns.

                <h3>Space Invaders Game!</h3>
                <p>
                    This is first real applicaiton that I had built. Hence it's first in the list. It's a simple space
                    invaders game that we all know and love by built using Python's Pygame Framework. Support on this
                    framework was low but nonetheless it was a fun project to work on.
                    The game is essentially a bunch of moving images. There's an infinite while that goes on while
                    images move aroudn the screent according to the user's input.
                    All these projects described in the website are on my Github so please do find them and let me know
                    what you think!!!

                <h3> Student Events Planner </h3>
                <p>
                    A web application that allows students to create events and invite other students to attend. The
                    application is built using Java Spring Boot, React, and PostgreSQL. The application is mostly built
                    to improve my understanding of design patterns.
                <p>
                <h3> Recipe App </h3>
                <p>
                    This is a recipe app that I built using React. It uses the Edamam API to fetch recipes and display
                    them to the user.
                    It has a simple search bar and once the user searches for a recipe, it displays the recipes in a
                    grid format.
                </p>
                <h3> Sudoku Solver </h3>
                <p>
                    This is a sudoku solver that I built using Python. It uses backtracking to solve the sudoku puzzle.
                    It takes in a 2D array of integers and solves the puzzle. It doesn't do much but if you give the 2D
                    array of integers representing the sudoku puzzle, it will solve it. Caveat it has to be solvable.
                    I'll probably take this project up again and make it more robust and playable.
